# Code Breakfast; learn to build a modern data pipeline

This tutorial contains the code that belongs to the code breakfast on the modern data pipelines: https://www.linkedin.com/events/6775427378744172544/

In this breakfast we'll set up an end to end analytics pipeline. First we dive into the theoretical part, where we discuss what makes a data pipeline modern, and introduce the technologies that we'll be using. By changing from ETL to ELT we build scalable pipelines that are easy to maintain. Leveraging managed services within the cloud such as BigQuery, or SaaS applications like Fivetran.

Misja will set up in around one hour a fully functional data pipeline where we fetch usage data from Github, and use dbt to build reporting on top of the data.

If you want to get in touch or want more information, feel free to contact Fokko Driesprong.

## Runbook

The [runbook](runbook.md) contains the steps to reproduce the pipeline.
